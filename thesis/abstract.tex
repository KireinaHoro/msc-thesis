\pengcheng{What is in-network-computing, introduce sPIN and PsPIN}
PsPIN is the RISC-V-based packet processing cluster that implements the sPIN in-network compute model proposed and developed at ETH Z{\"u}rich. 

\pengcheng{What composes a full SmartNIC}
While the design is fully synthesizable and comes with a cycle-accurate simulation model, it requires various other hardware and software components to function as a full system at realistic speeds. 

\pengcheng{FPsPIN; hardware and software system}
This project, FPsPIN, bridges the gap by developing a fully-functional demo FPGA SmartNIC based on PsPIN.  The demo system serves as a Proof-of-Concept for PsPIN in ASIC and facilitates future software and hardware development of the sPIN ecosystem.
