In conclusion, reading and writing a file from within the kernel is a bad, bad thing to do. Never do it. Ever. Both modules from this article, along with a Makefile for compiling them, are available from the Linux Journal FTP site, but we expect to see no downloads in the logs. And, I never told you how to do it either. You picked it up from someone else, who learned it from his sister's best friend, who heard about how to do it from her coworker.
