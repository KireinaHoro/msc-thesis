\begin{chapquote}{John Drury Clark, \textit{Ignition!}}
Their guess turned out to be right, but one is reminded of E. T. Bell's remark that the great vice of the Greeks was not sodomy but extrapolation.

Throughout the process of building the FPsPIN demo, we ...

\section{Reliability layer: SLMP} \label{sec:slmp}
\pengxu{protocol should be message oriented (instead of TCP).  reliability requirements: SCTP, DCCP, SLMP, pure UDP}
